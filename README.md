# Shark-attacks-analysis

In this project I used information related to shark attacks globally.I used python to process the data and to create the maps and the plots, which helped me to draw some concliusons.

The main cause of this project is to expand my knowledge in programming, especially in python language and in some important libraries such as pandas, matplotlib etc. and also to gain some experience in data analysis.

This project provides information about shark attacks, the countries where these attacks occure more often, the most common activites people do before an attack etc. Someone aware of these data may avoid performing actions that increase the chances off getting attacked by a shark when he is at sea, so I hope this project contributes in less shark related incidents.
